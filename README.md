## __Features of Note__

#### Todo List In line Additions
You can add a new todo list and see it appended to the end of your lists without having to navigate away from your List's index, allowing you to quickly reference your other tasks.

#### Message Board
Integrating the React-Quill library gives these messages their rich-text styling and the ability to safely re-render user-inputted text, regardless of the content.

#### _Backend Routes_
For easy connection between projects, lists, users and other associated data, routes have been nested under their `projectId`s.
